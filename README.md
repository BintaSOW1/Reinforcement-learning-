# Reinforcement-learning

This code provides a basic implementation of Q-learning for a simple game environment. It starts by defining the game environment as a 2D grid, where positive rewards indicate goal states, negative rewards indicate obstacles, and zero rewards represent the neutral state. The Q-table is initialized with zeros, and the Q-learning update equation is applied during the training loop to update the Q-values based on observed rewards and actions. Finally, an evaluation loop measures the agent's performance by playing the game using the learned Q-values.
